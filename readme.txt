In this assignment you will produce a Blackjack Program – blackjack is the American version of the 
classic English card game of Pontoon and the French 21’s, and it is the version that is played in almost 
all the casinos around the world. Your programming skills in general will be tested using C#.
All of the players involved in a game play individually against the dealer, hence the rules can be 
considered on a single player versus dealer level. Blackjack is essentially a competition between dealer 
and player to see who can get closest to 21 without busting. The basic rules are as follows:
Basic Rules
• The player is dealt two cards face up, and the dealer one card face up.
• The player then has the choice to keep taking cards (twist) until he chooses to stay (stick), or 
until his hand totals more than 21. If this happens the player is deemed to have bust and loses 
the hand and his bet. The hand is then over.
• A hand present total is calculated by simply summing the face value of the cards in it. All picture 
cards have a value of 10, and Aces may have a value of either 1 or 11 at any time.
• If the player has stayed on 21 or less it is the dealer’s turn to take cards. 
• The dealer follows very fixed rules – he keeps taking cards until he has at least 17. Thus, the 
dealer must stop when he gets 17 or more.
• If through taking cards the dealer’s total exceeds 21 he too busts. If the dealer busts and the 
player still remains, then the player wins the hand.
• If the dealer does not bust the winner of the hand is the person with the highest total, whether 
that be the dealer or the player. 
• If the totals are identical then is a draw.
• If the player has lost he forfeits his bet. If he wins he receives double what he bet (even money).
